Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. 
The select element is a container for a group of option elements, 
and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. 
Both elements require closing tags.

textarea element adds a field that allows customizable rows and columns unline input element
use rows and cols attributes to specify rows and columns

placeholder attribute tells a hint of what the user is to type
The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until the user starts typing.


With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, 
to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. 
This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.

You can use the :not(:last-of-type) pseudo-class to select all but the last element.

It would be nicer to have the label text appear above the form elements.

Select all input, textarea, and select elements, and make them take up the full width of their parent elements.

Also, add 10px of margin to the top of the selected elements. Set the other margins to 0.

with border color and size are all in the function eg. 1px olid color 


a form is started is with the form element, and label elenment is nested within
an input elemnt is nested within the label
